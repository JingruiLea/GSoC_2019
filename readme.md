# Low-Power Interrupt-Based Drivers in CÃ©u-Arduino - GSoC 2019

This repo describes all works I've done on GSoC 2019.

## Analog I2C

This driver can be used to communicate via TWI **as master only**, compatible with I2C.

It API is same as `Interrupt-Based I2C`.

## Interrupt-Based I2C

This library allows you to communicate with I2C / TWI devices. It provides basically the same function as the Arduino Wire library.

## EEPROM Driver

EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read-only memory) is user-modifiable read-only memory (ROM) that can be erased and reprogrammed (written to) repeatedly through the application of higher than normal electrical voltage.

The driver of EEPROM is in the /eeprom/eeprom folder.

## GY-30 Driver

GY-30 Digital Light Sensor Module is a carrier board for light intensity sensor BH1750FVI. The range of the board is between 0lx and 65535lx. The board communicates via I2C protocol.

The driver of GY-30 is in the /GY30/GY30 folder.

## Sample Oscilloscope by Arduino and Python

The Oscilloscope contains a sample 'Arduino Oscilloscope'.  
You can draw a line chart of pin voltage changes.

## RC522 Driver (Incompleted)

Mifare RC522 is the high integrated RFID card reader.

The RC522 folder contains the basic API for interacting with the RC522 RFID reader.
